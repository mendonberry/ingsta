Install
-------

```bash
$ pip install instagram-scraper
```

To update instagram-scraper:

```

Usage
-----

To scrape a public user's media:
```bash
$ instagram-scraper <username>             
```
*By default, downloaded media will be placed in `<current working directory>/<username>`.*


To scrape a hashtag for media:
```bash
$ instagram-scraper <hashtag without #> --tag          
```
*It may be useful to specify the `--maximum <#>` argument to limit the total number of items to scrape when scraping by hashtag.*


To scrape a private user's media when you are an approved follower:
```bash
$ instagram-scraper <username> -u <your username> -p <your password>
```

To specify multiple users, pass a delimited list of users:
```bash
$ instagram-scraper username1,username2,username3           
```

You can also supply a file containing a list of usernames:
```bash
$ instagram-scraper -f ig_users.txt           
```

```
# ig_users.txt

username1
username2
username3

# and so on...
```
*The usernames may be separated by newlines, commas, semicolons, or whitespace.*


OPTIONS
-------

```
--help -h           Show help message and exit.

--login_user  -u    Instagram login user.

--login_pass  -p    Instagram login password.

--filename    -f    Path to a file containing a list of users to scrape.

--destination -d    Specify the download destination. By default, media will 
                    be downloaded to <current working directory>/<username>.

--retain_username -n  Creates a username subdirectory when the destination flag is
                      set.

--media_types -t    Specify media types to scrape. Enter as space separated values. 
                    Valid values are image, video, story, or none. Stories require
                    a --login_user and --login_pass to be defined.

--latest            Scrape only new media since the last scrape. Uses the last modified
                    time of the latest media item in the destination directory to compare.

--quiet       -q    Be quiet while scraping.

--maximum     -m    Maximum number of items to scrape.

--media_metadata    Saves the media metadata associated with the user's posts to 
                    <destination>/<username>.json. Can be combined with --media_types none
                    to only fetch the metadata without downloading the media.

--tag               Scrapes the specified hashtag for media.

--location          Scrapes the specified location for media.
